I've recently reinstalled Windows XP MCE 2005 back on my old computer (need to for software issues) and after installing SP3 the System Properties page shows that it's MCE 2002. I know this was a known bug by Microsoft but I'm wondering if there is any way to fix it or to manually change that data via registry or files. I know it's silly but it's just something I want fixed.

I'm a mostly Windows user who dabbled in the Mint Cinnamon OS a few years ago on an older desktop but I don't really know what's the right fit for the job in terms of performance/features.

So I recently started up a family members old Dell XPS 400, running Windows xp Media Center Edition, as far as I knew the only thing wrong with it was a burnt out old video card. Since the motherboard has no onboard video display my family member thought all was lost and never used it again. I have since replaced the Old video card, started it up, xp booted normally but when I get to the user login screen, the users are faded and transparent-like plus it's gray and unresponsive to my mouse. I have a 2004 windows xp mce by emachines, model # T6524 ( It is my parents and i was trying to reinstall windows without the disc and it worked because i started it at 12am sunday and i looked at it monday morning and it was fine, but when i got home, i was getting yelled at because it wasn't working. The error display reads like this exactly: Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:. This is my parents laptop and I am just wondering if I can do a fresh install of windows Media Center Edition and use the same key if it is from a different yar, and a different service pack. If not, any other ideas of how to get the right version w/o having toi pay Dell for a new disk? Already tried to see if there was a reformat partition on the drive from the boot menu and no luck there. Thank you in advance. Hey guys! I'm having issues actually accessing files from the XP machine by the Windows 7 machine. The computer shows up in the network, but whenever I try to connect to the XP machine, I'm prompted to enter a username and password. I can't figure out how to disable this prompt (or even to figure out what the user name and password are.). My googling skills have led me to realize that this seems like a common problem, but I've yet to find a solution that fixes my problem. 
I've got a Roamio Plus at one home and a Windows XP MCE computer at another. When I stream video from online.tivo.com, the quality is unwatchable, full of dropouts and glitches, and my CPU usage often hits 99%. YouTube, Netflix, and even Slingbox-streamed video from the same location all work fine on this setup. (And CPU usage rarely climbs above 25%) Does anyone know anything about the specific codecs used by Roamio DVRs for TiVo online? Is there a recommended web browser or specific. EDIT2: Since many of you have asked, I feel I needed to address this. NO. I do not charge my family for working on their computers. I actually offer to work for free nearly all the time. Even if I hand the money back, she uses her magic grandmother powers to make sure I get it somehow. So, y'all can quit calling me scumbags now. :P Now, I am not a professional, but consider myself very good with computers. Because of the fact that I am the only one in my family I found service pack 3 but requires service pack 1 is there a common place to get these updates? if not can I move them from a windows xp mce to a computer with windows I have a Dell XPS M2010 laptop ( "Isn't it glorious?") that is going on 10 years old. It originally came with Windows XP MCE but I've always kept it updated with the latest OS: Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and now 10. The last drivers Dell released for this PC were for Vista, but these drivers continued to work properly for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. When Microsoft started nagging me about the W10 upgrade, the compatibility checker warned me that W10 does not suppor. I am trying to install windows 7 on my old dell inspirion laptop. It came pre loaded with windows xp MCE 2005. My sister shut the lid of the laptop with headphones on the keyboard, and almost totally destroyed the screen. I then hooked up the laptop to an external monitor and decided to install the windows 7 beta on it (right when the windows 7 beta went live, it was a genuine regestered version) and this was around 2009. Fast forward to the present and ive dug this old laptop out again I use an old Windows XP MCE machine to record TV, shortly I will be updating it to a Windows 7 machine but I don't think that will make any difference to my problem. Windows MCE (XP and 7) record TV shows in a proprietary format called DVR-MS which is essentially just a tagged version of MPG2. I can easily run a conversion process to change them to something more portable with an app like WinAVI, but what I really want to do is automate/schedule the process. I know this might be a bit of old news but it's brand new to me. I started with a Windows XP MCE last time I tried something like this so it's been awhile but just now I discovered that I can right click any MP3 file I've got and saw an option for play to and 360 Slim popped up. I'm running a Windows 7 pro laptop with the normal installation of Zune (for my phone) and discovering something like this after 7 years of 360s is fucking awesome. Apparently all you need to set up a Media center. 
I need your help, r/gaming. I'm having some serious issues with Steam and my source games, mainly TF2. My steam client itself crashes frequently (typical "encountered problem, needs to shut down" BS) at which point I have to reboot my whole system to get it running again. And as far as running games goes, I keep getting the "Steam is verifying game files" right after "preparing to launch x." box, after which point the game DOESN'T launch. Again, nothing will work until a full system reboot. Hey guys and gals, I ran in to a stumper here that I just can't seem to figure out. I have a laptop that will boot up into XP fine, but after 5-10 minutes, EVERYTHING freezes except for the mouse. The windows stop responding to any clicks, the taskbar disappears, the screensaver doesn't come up, etc. This only happens in Normal mode. Safe Mode = I can keep it on for hours without any problems. So far, I've tried, running MBAM, CCleaner, chkdsk /r, Defraggler, Avast I have an old ibm thinkpad t30 that served admirably for a decade until it was chunked across a room in a bag by accident. The screen fried, but it otherwise still works fine as tested using an external monitor. My question is how I can go about connecting it to a tv. It is running windows xp mce. i have tried the s video output with no results to a tube tv and tried a vga-s video adapter and had no luck. I do have a lcd I can try, but otherwise nothing. I know it is trying as the screen. what memory4less says my computer needs and the pricing for the ram, it also shows the stats for the laptop ( THe laptop currently has 512mb of ram. I think its just one stick. I'm kind of broke right now and i'd like to spend as little as possible to get this done and working well. How can i make this happen, where do i purchase that has a decent return policy if the RAM doesn't Firstly, I am running Windows XP MCE, and have a Nvidea Geforce 8600 GT running two monitors. Knowing this, can anyone tell me why I can't seem to figure out how to run TF2, in fullscreen mode, on my monitor designated as secondary? Is this even possible? It might even sound like a stupid thing to want to do, but I have my reasons. I am now in possession of a PC with ~35% fragmentation (110GB NTFS drive). I've been using Defraggler but after 10+ hours it has only made it down to 30%. It is an old PC. I was wondering if there is any hardware, OS, application, or procedure I can use to speed up this process. Are there any applications that can make use of an external hard drive to help defrag? It has 512MB of RAM, a 2.5Ghz P4, and Windows XP MCE. (I upgraded it from SP1 to SP3). It was made around.
