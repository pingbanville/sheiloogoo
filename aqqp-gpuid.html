                            <p>Hi everyone, I am overclocking my gtx 950 right now and was wondering what results you guys got?

Hello everyone. So, here are the specs of my build: Intel i7 3930k @ 3.2Ghz, EVGA Nvidia Geforce GTX 680 the overclocked version, 12GB of G.SKILL Ripjaw RAM, Asus Sabertooth x79 Motherboard, Western Digital WD Green WD20EARX 2TB 64MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/s 3.5" Internal Hard Drive So, I've noticed that I'm getting rather substantial frame rate drops in the games that I'm playing, when I think I shouldn't. I'll go from a smooth and stable 60fps down to 45-35fps. I'm running games on their Graphics card and GPU database with specifications for products launched in recent years. Includes clocks, photos, and technical details. I started playing Oldschool RuneScape but I'm really struggling to read the tiny text on my monitor. The game has no UI scaling options so the only real workaround is to change your monitor's DPI scaling setting. Well, instead of doing this manually every time I decided to try to automate it. As far as I can tell there is no other utility out there which does this, so hopefully this will be of use to somebody. This requires Windows 10. You will need to change the default variables

I picked up an EVGA GTX 1070 SC on eBay last week. When I got it everything seemed ok. Ran gpuid on it and what do you know, it has Samsung memory in it. yay! So I'm thinking I won't have an issues with overckocking at all. All of my other 1070s are hynix and I can push 31Mh/s with 70% power easy. For some reason this Samsung card won't OC for shit though. I can bump it up slow and get to about 30 but if I have to reset miner for whatever reason, It crashes. 22 окт 2018  Еще вопросик (сорри если не туда) - ошибка "AMD Invalid Result GPU ID 0" это из какой оперы? переразгон, железо или? 24.10.2018. Does anyone know or have a way to enable WDDM in one shot across all GPUs without having to find the GPU ID and turn it on per\-device each device? I am currently using nvidia\-smi in cmd as `nvidia-smi -g GPUID:xx:xx.x -fdm 0` to disable TCC/enable WDDM on each GPU I have individually, one at a time, which can take time.

thought you guys might find this interesting: i skimmed about a MB of text posts from the new and top pages and fed them into a lstm neural network, . unique words owned by specific persons remain their property. temperature is a measure of risk: 0.0 will repeat the same words over and over while 1.0 while often misspell words but will be a lot more interesting. primetext is some text that you give the network to give it some context: in this one i chose "he ran faster than the warp drive AMD Radeon способны ускорять "физику" с помощью PhysX. DO they have a phone number? or anything other than mailing address and email (to which they dont respond to) Prologue: I had not played BF4 in months. Decided to hop on for a sesh with friends and got kicked for Perma ban on my GPUID. Contated them and they said I might of been hacked, no other help than that. Now im stuck with no responses from them. No game. and "wasted200" hours. Только на плате надо будет найти резисторы, отвечающие за gpu id. У 460- ой он 10DE - 0E22, а у 560-ой 10DE - 1201.

Hardware: I7-7700k Nvidia GTX 1070 (not used) I'm having a issue where i suddenly can't boot.Since I've been using my hackintosh for a few months now without any issues i will give some of the details that are relevant: i cant boot if i use inject intel with the fake gpuid which previously worked fine but i can boot without it although then i get no recognized drivers and nothing works.

I built a strong gaming rig about 4 and a half years ago, intending for it to be at least relatively future proof. But in recent years I haven't been into particularly modern games, so I haven't really been stressing my system. Therefore, I have no idea how good it will be at running newer games. However, that's all going to change when the Summer Sale hits, because I have every intention of picking up The Witcher 3, Far Cry 4, GTA 5, Dragon Age: Inquisition, possibly Dark Souls 2, and perhaps. Hey everyone! I've been trying to train a neural net using the code from here (https://github.com/larspars/word-rnn) on just over 3 million tweets. It seems like either the network is converging only to stopwords (e.g. "me me me me me") or it's not converging at all. Here's the training code: th train.lua -gpuid 0 -print_every 100 -eval_val_every 20000 -word_level 1 -threshold 50 -rnn_size 64 Here's some training output. I know it's not finished training My Brethren I have been walking in darkness for over a year. Yey for it was nigh onto a year now when I purchased my second video card to run in crossfire. The day of install was reverent and happy as I slid the 7970 in and all was well in my eyes. My brothers I was shocked, there was minimal improvement in performance but there WAS improvement. I was lead to believe by erroneous information on the web that I was good and well  brothers and sisters  I was far from that. My brother. 
Like the title says, I am trying to sell my GPU, I don't have much time to game anymore and seeing as I sold my cpu long ago and went back to a phenom II 965 BE, it created a bottleneck. I was initially trying to get a GTX 770 but I rather upgrade my cpu and other stuff. I have since bought a GTX 650 and that seems to be enough for my now casual gaming. This card has never been pushed, overclocked or tempered in any way. Never used it for mining. Smoke free home. 先月ようやく、今時のGPU付きのノートパソコンを購入できたので、本格的に趣味でDeepLearningに取り組めるように. </p>
